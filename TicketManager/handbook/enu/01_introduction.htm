<p>Bug Tracker is a PHP web based bug tracking system. It helps you manage 
software development. It uses a database to store issues to be done, bugs to be 
fixed, and features to be added.</p>

<p>Most people are just like me, have limit bug-storing slots in their brains. 
It&#39;s easy to remember one or two issues. However, old issue will be swapped out 
when new one received. With a bug tracking system, bugs can be managed easier. 
All software development history can be stored in the database for future 
reference. Keeping a database of bugs is essential for a good software developing 
team.</p>

<p>Bug Tracker has two user interfaces. One is for internal developing team. The 
other is for customers or end users to report their feedback. It has flexible 
user/group permission management, database search/filter functions, FAQ and 
document management, and more. Please refer to the rest of this document.</p>

<p>The Bug Tracker is a high performance application. It has been well tested. 
After tested its capacity on AMD 1G Hz CPU and 256 MB RAM machine running 
FreeBSD 5.3, we found that when there are 1000 users, 10000 anonymous users, 
10000 reports, 10000 documents, and 10000 FAQ, the system is still very smooth.</p>

<p><a name="1.3"><tt class="chtitle2">1.3 History of Bug Tracker</tt></a></p>

<p>The Bug Tracker is developed by Wang, Chun-Pin (Alex Wang). He had developed 
a tracking system and customer feedback system for <a href="http://www.synology.com">Synology 
Inc</a>. It was the first version of Bug Tracker. The system Synology was using is 
relatively simple, not well organized, and has many Synology specified 
functions. The system has been run more than 3 years until now.</p>

<p>After Alex left the Synology at the first time, he gave himself a long vacation to develop his 
own projects. He developed a FTP daemon and intended to open source. He needs a 
bug tracking system. The system he developed for Synology is copyrighted and has many drawbacks. He wanted to re-write a tracking system long time ago anyway. So he 
re-designed the tracking system and wrote a new one - Bug Tracker. The Bug 
Tracker is well organized. It has more features,  friendlier interface, and 
more languages supported.</p>

<p>It was a pity that the Bug Tracker had only one user. So he gave it for free 
to some companies, <a href="http://www.storlink.com.tw">Storlink Semiconductors, 
Inc.</a>, subsidiary of ASUS. Finally, it&#39;s time to open source!!</p>
