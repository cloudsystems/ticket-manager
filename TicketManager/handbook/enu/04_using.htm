<p><a name="4.1"><tt class="chtitle2">4.1 Project Management</tt></a></p>

<p>Once you have done the system configuration and added uses and groups, you can 
start to add projects. Only the admin or groups that have the permission to add/edit 
project can do the project management.</p>

<p>Here are the instructions for each field on adding/editing project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Project Name: As implied by the name, it&#39;s the name of the project.</li>
  <li>Area/Minor Area: You can assign area and area owner here. When a user reports 
  a bug, they could select area and minor area. The system will automatically change 
the &quot;assign to&quot; to the area owner. For example, if the project is a mail server 
product, you might have the areas: Kernel, Web mail, Management UI, Network 
protocol. Under the &quot;Network protocol&quot;, you could specify minor area. Such as: 
SMTP, POP3, IMAP, etc.</li>
  <li>Auto Mailto: When users report bugs, the system will send notification email 
to the users listed in &quot;Auto Mailto&quot;. Normally, we will add the 
  project manager to the 
list. So they will be well aware of the status of every report.</li>
  <li>Feedback Receiver: When customers report bugs on the feedback system, the system 
will send email to users listed in the &quot;Feedback Receiver&quot; and send a blind carbon 
copy to &quot;Auto Mailto&quot;. So the &quot;Feedback Receiver&quot; should be the customer support 
staffs.</li>
  <li>Pattern of Version: This is the pattern of your software version. The 
  system will generate combo boxes according to the pattern. If you would like to 
  use a numeric in combo box, please use % to represent the numeral. If you would 
  like to use a alphabet character in combo box, please use &quot;@&quot; to represent the character. For 
  example, if the version is SDS-1-1.12 and you would like 1.12 to be combo box, 
  the pattern should be SDS-1-%.%%. If the &quot;Pattern of Version&quot; is empty, the 
  system will just show an input box.</li>
  <li>Accessible By: Configure users that are allowed to access the project. Please 
  select user and click &quot;Add &gt;&gt;&quot; to add user and &quot;&lt;&lt; Remove&quot; to remove user from 
  the list. You can press [Ctrl] or [Shift] on the keyboard to select multiple users.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="4.2"><tt class="chtitle2">4.2 Report Management</tt></a></p>

<p>After entering the project list and selecting a project, you can start to 
add/edit/delete reports. In the project list page, you will see all reports in 
the project. Users can customize columns to display on their &quot;preference&quot; setting 
page.</p>

<p>A normal report life cycle will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>QC/user reports a bug. The status of the report is &quot;New&quot;.</li>
  <li>R&amp;D manager assigns the bug to R&amp;D staff.</li>
  <li>R&amp;D staff fixes the bug, changes the status to &quot;Fixed - need to verify&quot; 
  and assigns it to QC.</li>
  <li>QC verifies the bug and changes the status to &quot;Fixed and verified&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p>The system will send an email notification to &quot;Assign To&quot;, Area/Minor Area 
owners, and CC to &quot;Auto Mailto&quot; that is set in project management.</p>

<p>In the project report list, you can search, filter, and sort reports. You may 
also change the columns to display in the list by setting your preference in the 
[System] -&gt; [Preference]. Clicking on the title bar of the list table allows you to sort 
reports by each column. You may switch the sort order by clicking on the title.</p>

<p>To search, just input the key word into the search input box. You may use 
&quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;not&quot; to perform advanced search. For 
example, if you would like to search report that contains &quot;FTP&quot; and &quot;HTTP&quot; but 
not including &quot;HTTPS&quot;, you can input &quot;FTP and HTTP not HTTPS&quot;. The key word 
search is case-insensitive. It will look into summary and report logs.</p>

<p>To use a filter, you have to add a new filter. The filter configuration is in 
[System] -&gt; [Set Filter]. You can use filter, sort, and search at the same time.</p>

<p>When reporting bugs, users can attach files (screen shots, system logs, and so 
on). The maximum file size depends on your configuration of php.ini.</p>

<p><a name="4.3"><tt class="chtitle2">4.3 Feedback System</tt></a></p>

<p>You can enable/disable the feedback system in [System] -&gt; [Feedback System]. 
Please see chapter 3.4 for more information.</p>

<p>The customer feedback system can be completely separated from Bug Tracker. 
All you need to do is just move the &quot;feedback_site&quot; directory to anywhere you 
want. For example, if you are accessing the Bug Tracker by
<a href="http://your.domain.com/bug">http://your.domain.com/bug</a>, the 
feedback system is now in <a href="http://your.domain.com/bug/feedback_site">
http://your.domain.com/bug/feedback_site</a>. You can move the &quot;feedback_site&quot; 
directory to the same directory level like Bug Tracker and change the name to 
&quot;feedback&quot;. Then you can access the feedback system by
<a href="http://your.domain.com/feedback">http://your.domain.com/feedback</a>. </p>

<p>Further more, you can also move the directory to another server. For example, 
you can put the Bug Tracker into an internal network and put the feedback system 
onto an 
external web server. Make sure you have edited the feedback_site/include/config.php 
and set the proper database information.</p>

<p>The feedback system interface is pretty much like Bug Tracker, only we try to make 
it even simpler to use. Customers can create new, update, and search reports. After 
created a new report, you can see the report in Bug Tracker [Project List] -&gt; [Project Name] 
-&gt; [Customer Feedback]. You can update the feedback in Bug Tracker customer 
feedback management interface.</p>

<p>A classical feedback life cycle will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Customer reports a feedback</li>
  <li>Internal customer service staff updates the feedback and/or requires more 
  information</li>
  <li>Customer updates the feedback again.</li>
  <li>Customer service staff decides whether it should be imported into internal 
  database. If not, just close it. Otherwise,</li>
  <li>Import into internal database.</li>
  <li>Internal users update the report.</li>
  <li>After the internal report is closed, the system will automatically update 
  the feedback system and close the feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a customer reports feedback, the system will send an email to the &quot;Feedback 
Receiver&quot; that you set for the project and a blind carbon copy to the &quot;Auto Mailto&quot; 
and a CC to&nbsp; the other users of the same company if the &quot;Receive notification when 
associate reports&quot; are turned on for the customer users.</p>

<p>After you update a customer&#39;s feedback, the system will send an email to the 
reporter and BCC, CC to the users described above. If you choose to import the 
feedback into the internal database, it will show an internal report form for you to 
input. After the feedback is imported, the system will create a link between 
them. When the internal report is closed, the system will close the external 
feedback, too.</p>

<p>There are two user management modes, anonymous and customer mode. You can 
disable or enable all of them. Under anonymous mode, users can register their 
account on the feedback system login page. Under customer mode, you would have 
to add customer user before they can use the Feedback System.</p>

<p>When a customer forgets his/her password, the system will send a new password to 
him/her. The new password will not be saved into real customer user database 
until login. If someone forges to request a password, the genuine user can still use 
old password to login and the new password will be dropped.</p>

<p>We will keep a system log of feedback system. You can check it at 
[Information] -&gt; [Feedback System Log].</p>

<p><a name="4.4"><tt class="chtitle2">4.4 FAQ Management</tt></a></p>

<p>Every project has its own FAQ system. You can categorize FAQ. A FAQ can 
belong to many categories. A normal FAQ life cycle will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Technical writer adds new FAQ categories.</li>
  <li>Add new FAQ and assign to the R&amp;D staff to verify the content.</li>
  <li>R&amp;D staff verifies the FAQ and changes the &quot;Is Verified&quot; to &quot;YES&quot;.</li>
  <li>Customers can see the verified FAQ on feedback system.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to perform the operation above, all related people should have the 
permission to manage FAQ. Un-verified FAQ will not be showed on feedback system.</p>

<p><a name="4.5"><tt class="chtitle2">4.5 Document</tt></a></p>

<p>The document system is designed to store internal documents, specifications, 
announcement, etc. You can categorize document by groups. You can deny users to 
access documents that do not belong to their group.&nbsp; </p>

<p>To see, create, update, or delete documents, users need have proper 
permissions. You can configure the document management permission on group 
management page.</p>

<p><a name="4.6"><tt class="chtitle2">4.6 Schedule</tt></a></p>

<p>You can use this function to manage your project schedule. Project team 
members can use the schedule to make plans, too. You can set the privilege on 
groups to allow users to see or edit schedule.</p>

<p>Only the system administrator or the schedule creator can modify or delete a 
schedule.</p>
